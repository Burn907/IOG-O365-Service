Create a Universal Distribution group in XXXXX in AD

Next you need to mail enable it:

Enable-DistributionGroup -Identity "rbi-uk dl cirium turbulence aware"
{This sets the default mail address of "name@reedelsevier..com

Next you need to make enable ability to accept emails from the internet which is not on by default

Set-DistributionGroup -Identity "rbi-uk dl cirium turb*" -RequireSenderAuthenticationEnabled $false

Now you can update the primary smtp address

Set-DistributionGroup -Identity "rbi-uk dl cirium turb*" -PrimarySmtpAddress Support-turbulence@cirium.com -emailaddresspolicyenabled $false

Now you can add members in the AD object in AD. If it is a contact card for an external address, you must select this in the AD filters
