Save the forward CSV import file to your C drive. As the mailboxes are in O365 the scripts will need to be run in O365 PowerShell :-
 
First import the data from the csv file:-
 
$BatchName= Import-csv c:\CMDForwardsCanadaBurnaby11Nov.csv 
 
Then run the following to double check the csv data has been loaded correctly:-
 
$Batchname
 
Then set the forwards (store and forward):-
 
$BatchName | foreach {Set-Mailbox $_.username -DeliverToMailboxAndForward $true -ForwardingAddress $_.Contact}
 
Then run this to check them:-
$BatchName | foreach {get-Mailbox $_.username | Select Name, PrimarySMTPAddress, ForwardingAddress, DeliverToMailboxAndForward}
